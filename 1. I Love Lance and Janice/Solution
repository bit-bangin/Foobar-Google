every lowercase letter [a..z] is replaced with the corresponding one
in [z..a], while every other character (including uppercase letters
and punctuation) is left untouched.
That is, 'a' becomes 'z', 'b' becomes 'y', 'c' becomes 'x', etc.
For instance, the word ""vmxibkgrlm"", when decoded, would become
""encryption"".
